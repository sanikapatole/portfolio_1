<h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
<p>To make Margherita Pizza, start by preparing the pizza dough. Combine flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Add olive oil and warm water, then knead until a smooth dough forms. Let it rise for about an hour. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible. Roll out the dough into a circle and place it on a baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a border for the crust. Arrange slices of fresh mozzarella on top of the sauce. Scatter torn basil leaves over the cheese. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Optionally, add thinly sliced or minced garlic for extra flavor. Bake the pizza in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted, usually about 10-15 minutes. Remove from the oven, slice, and serve hot. Enjoy your delicious Margherita Pizza!</p>
